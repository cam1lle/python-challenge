# Financial Analysis with Python (PyBank) and Election Analysis (PyPoll)

## Background
In this assignment, I utilized Python programming to complete two real-world data analysis tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. The PyBank challenge involves analyzing financial records, while the PyPoll challenge focuses on analyzing election data. Both tasks demonstrate the application of Python scripting skills to extract insights from large datasets efficiently.

## Repository Setup
To set up the project repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Created a new repository named "python-challenge" for the assignment.
2. Cloned the repository to the local machine.
3. Created two folders within the repository: PyBank and PyPoll.
4. Added the following content to each folder:
* main.py: The main script to run for each analysis.
* Resources folder: Contains the CSV files used for analysis.
* Analysis folder: Contains the text file with the results from the analysis.
5. Pushed the changes to the remote repository on GitHub or GitLab.

## PyBank Instructions
For the PyBank challenge, I was provided with a financial dataset named "budget_data.csv". The dataset consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records and calculates the following values:

* Total number of months included in the dataset
* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes
* Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The script produces the analysis results, including the above values, which are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

## PyPoll Instructions
For the PyPoll challenge, I was given a dataset called "election_data.csv". The dataset consists of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The objective was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the following values:

* Total number of votes cast
* Complete list of candidates who received votes
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* Total number of votes each candidate won
* Winner of the election based on the popular vote
The analysis results, including the above values, are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

## Hints and Considerations
During the completion of the challenges, the following hints and considerations were kept in mind:

* Utilize the knowledge of importing modules like csv, reading and writing files, storing data in variables, lists, and dictionaries, iterating through data structures, and debugging.
* Break down the tasks into discrete mini-objectives to tackle them effectively.
* The provided datasets are large to showcase the limitations of Excel-based analysis and highlight the power of Python for handling big data.
* Each challenge should be approached separately by writing a script specific to the dataset. Run each script individually to ensure code functionality and accuracy.
* Regularly commit the work and push changes to the repository to maintain a backup and prevent data loss. Include a detailed README.md file in the repository.
